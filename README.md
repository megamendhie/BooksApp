# Books App  
The Firebase SDK doesn't provide a direct function to perform OR query in Cloud Firestore. So I built this this to demo an alternative way of performing OR query in Firestore.  
  
  
Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) allows you to send push notifications directly from Firebase console or with an app server or some other trusted environment where the server logic runs. However, you may want to send push notifications between devices, like in most chat apps, but without writing any server-side code. Of course, itâ€™s very possible. 
  
**Requirements**
- Basic knowledge of Android development
- Android Studio (version 3.x or later)  
- Create a Firebase  project and link it to your app
